# System Kickstart

### What?

A simple Ansible project to manage mostly the user's own machine.
**Note:** This is not for any certification preperation (like RHCE). This is meant for personal usage (and probably for others in the future).

### Why?

So the cycle goes like this:

1. I install Fedora as my reliable daily driver.
2. I begin to setup the things I want, the way I want.
3. I create a mess over time or go and try messing at some other place (distro hopping).
4. I don't like things as they are now.
5. I nuke the current world and go to step 1.

Over time, I have learnt not to create mess elsewhere but I still create them here (at Fedora), can't help it.
Rest of the steps are fine EXCEPT for 2nd. It's the most redundant, time consuming piece of crap! So I thought of taking care of it by "automating" it.
